Asynchronous TCP socket module for python 3.  Inspired by the design of
Boost ASIO.  The asio module currently supports TCP sockets only, and 
supports asynchronous versions of common client operations (connect, read,
write) and server operations (accept).

A small TCP proxy implementation is also included as an example (proxy.py).

This module existed before python 3.4 and its new asyncio module.  If you're using 
python 3.4 or later and need a way to do asynchronous sockets, you probably want
asyncio instead of this.
